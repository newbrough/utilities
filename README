Share utilities across OOI projects.

Note: these classes may have NO dependencies on any other OOI projects.
Non-project eggs are ok, BUT keep in mind that making this project depend on an egg
means making EVERY other project will depend on this egg too.

Current dependencies are pyyaml and graypy.
